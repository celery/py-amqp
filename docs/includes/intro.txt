About
=====

This is a Python3-only fork of py-amqp_ which is
a fork of amqplib_ which was originally written by Barry Pederson.
aio-py-amqp is maintained by Matthias Urlichs <matthias@urlichs.de>

Differences from `py-amqp`_
===========================

- Python 3.4+ only
- All methods have an ``*_async`` counterpart which is a coroutine.
  Calling the non-async version while its asyncio loop is running
  triggers an error.
- A separate coroutine reads data from the connection and dispatches
  incoming packets, ``Connection.drain_events`` is gone
- Support for timeouts, via asyncio's standard mechanisms
  (i.e. asyncio.wait_for and cancelling)

Differences from `amqplib`_
===========================

- Channels are restored after channel error, instead of having to close the
  connection.
- Support for heartbeats

    - ``Connection.heartbeat_tick(rate=2)`` must called at regular intervals
      (half of the heartbeat value if rate is 2).
    - Or some other scheme by using ``Connection.send_heartbeat``.
- Supports RabbitMQ extensions:
    - Consumer Cancel Notifications
        - by default a cancel results in ``ChannelError`` being raised
        - but not if a ``on_cancel`` callback is passed to ``basic_consume``.
    - Publisher confirms
        - ``Channel.confirm_select()`` enables publisher confirms.
        - ``Channel.events['basic_ack'].append(my_callback)`` adds a callback
          to be called when a message is confirmed. This callback is then
          called with the signature ``(delivery_tag, multiple)``.
    - Exchange-to-exchange bindings: ``exchange_bind`` / ``exchange_unbind``.
        - ``Channel.confirm_select()`` enables publisher confirms.
        - ``Channel.events['basic_ack'].append(my_callback)`` adds a callback
          to be called when a message is confirmed. This callback is then
          called with the signature ``(delivery_tag, multiple)``.
- Support for ``basic_return``
- Uses AMQP 0-9-1 instead of 0-8.
    - ``Channel.access_request`` and ``ticket`` arguments to methods
      **removed**.
    - Supports the ``arguments`` argument to ``basic_consume``.
    - ``internal`` argument to ``exchange_declare`` removed.
    - ``auto_delete`` argument to ``exchange_declare`` deprecated
    - ``insist`` argument to ``Connection`` removed.
    - ``Channel.alerts`` has been removed.
    - Support for ``Channel.basic_recover_async``.
    - ``Channel.basic_recover`` deprecated.
- Exceptions renamed to have idiomatic names:
    - ``AMQPException`` -> ``AMQPError``
    - ``AMQPConnectionException`` -> ConnectionError``
    - ``AMQPChannelException`` -> ChannelError``
    - ``Connection.known_hosts`` removed.
    - ``Connection`` no longer supports redirects.
    - ``exchange`` argument to ``queue_bind`` can now be empty
      to use the "default exchange".
- Adds ``Connection.is_alive`` that tries to detect
  whether the connection can still be used.
- Adds ``Connection.connection_errors`` and ``.channel_errors``,
  a list of recoverable errors.
- Exposes the underlying socket as ``Connection.sock``.
- Adds ``Channel.no_ack_consumers`` to keep track of consumer tags
  that set the no_ack flag.
- Slightly better at error recovery
